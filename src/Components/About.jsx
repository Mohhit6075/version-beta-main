            Version Beta is the amalgamation of some of the nation&apos;s
            greatest technological minds, with an ideal platform for technology
            enthusiasts to demonstrate their talents and ingenuity. After
            successfully organizing its digital variation for the last two years
            we are back this year, grander than ever, to build on the legacy of
            our offline editions. To bring you an array of diverse activities,
            we have included synchronized delivery of workshops, and guest
            speakers of the highest caliber from the world of technology and
            entrepreneurship. It is accompanied by a 36-hour hack-a-thon powered
            by MLH, the largest in central India, allowing participants to test
            their intelligence, be recognized and get rewarded while rubbing
            shoulders with the offline NIT-B campus experience and real-time
            guidance from the MLH community. In a stroke, Version Beta is the
            souls&apos; satisfiers of tech aficionados while fostering the next
            generation of developers, thinkers, and entrepreneurs.
